# Diplomatic Transcription Expander

Turn abbreviated medieval Latin text (diplomatic transcriptions) into full, readable form. You give it an XML file with the original text; it gives back the same file with abbreviations expanded.

**You need:** Python 3.10+ and (for online expansion) a free Gemini API key.

---

## Quick start (easiest way)

1. **Install Python**  
   If you don’t have it, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/). On install, check “Add Python to PATH.”

2. **Get an API key** (free)  
   Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) and create an API key. You’ll paste it into the app.

3. **Open the app**  
   In a terminal/command prompt, go to the project folder and run:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

4. **Use it**  
   - Click **Open…** and choose your XML file  
   - Paste your API key when asked (or put it in a `.env` file once)  
   - Click **Expand**  
   - Click **Save…** when done

---

## Step-by-step setup

### 1. Install dependencies

Open a terminal (or Command Prompt on Windows) in the project folder and run:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

On **Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On **Windows:**
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Then:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(These commands create an isolated environment and install the required libraries.)*

### 2. Set your API key

You have two options:

**Option A – Paste when asked**  
The app will ask for your key the first time you expand. You can choose to save it in a `.env` file so you don’t have to enter it again.

**Option B – Save it beforehand**  
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the project folder, open `.env` in a text editor, and add:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
Get a key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

**Important:** Never share or upload `.env` — it contains your secret key.

---

## Using the graphical interface (GUI)

Run:
```bash
python gui.py
```

### Main actions

| Button | What it does |
|--------|--------------|
| **Open…** | Load an XML file |
| **Expand** | Expand abbreviations (online with Gemini or locally). During expansion, changes to **Queued (N)** showing queue count. Click again to toggle the current file in/out of queue. |
| **Save…** | Save the expanded result |
| **◀** / **▶** | Previous/next XML file in the same folder |
| **Re-expand** | Re-expand from the original file; keeps original on left, new result on right. Uses updated examples and learned pairs. |
| **Batch…** | Expand multiple XML files in a folder in parallel |

**Keyboard shortcuts:** Ctrl+O (Open), Ctrl+S (Save), Ctrl+E (Expand), Ctrl+← / Ctrl+→ (prev/next file in folder)

**Expansion Queue:** When an expansion is running, the **Expand** button shows **Queued (N)** with the number of queued files. Click it to add the current file to the queue, or click again to remove it. The tool automatically processes queued expansions one after another. You can see "Queue: N" in the status bar and click **Clear Q** to empty the entire queue.

### Settings

- **Backend** – Use **Gemini** (online, needs API key) or **Local** (no key, uses rules or Ollama).
- **Model** – Which Gemini model to use (hidden when Backend is Local). Default: gemini-3-flash-preview. Click **⟳** to refresh the available models from the API.
- **Whole doc** – When checked (default), expand the entire document in one API call. Uncheck for block-by-block expansion (e.g. for very long documents or progress display).
- **Modality** – How much to expand manuscript transcriptions: conservative, normalize, full, aggressive, or **local** (tuned for non-Gemini models like Ollama; not the default).
- **Simul.** – How many blocks to process at once. Lower this (e.g. 1) if you see rate limit errors.
- **Learn** – When on, the app saves new abbreviation pairs from each expansion to improve future runs.
- **Layered Training** – When on, includes learned examples in the expansion prompt (curated + learned).

### If expansion fails

- **No API key** – Paste your key when prompted, or add it to `.env`.
- **Rate limit (429)** – Lower **Parallel** to 1, wait a minute, then try again.
- **Timeout / hangs** – Try the **Local** backend, or adjust `GEMINI_TIMEOUT` in `.env` (increase for large docs with Whole doc mode, e.g. 180).
- **Want to avoid the API** – Switch **Backend** to **Local**; the app will use rules and (if installed) Ollama.

### Extra features

- **Diff** – Show a unified diff between input and output (like `diff input.xml output.xml`), so you can see exactly what the expansion changed.
- **Input→TXT** / **Output→TXT** – Export text blocks to plain `.txt` files.
- **Click to sync** – Click a block in input or output to jump to the matching block in the other panel.
- **Double-click companion line** – Double-click a block to select it in both panels and show the matching line in the companion XML. The program opens the companion file in the other panel if needed (e.g. `filename_expanded.xml` when you double-click in input, or `filename.xml` when you double-click in output), then scrolls to the same block index so you always see input and output from the same pair of files.
- **Image panel** – Click the 🖼▶ strip on the right to expand and upload an image for reference.
- **Passes** – Run expansion more than once in a row to refine the text.

## Teaching the app (examples)

The app learns from example pairs: “this abbreviation” → “this full form”.

### In the GUI

Use the **Train** section at the bottom:

1. Type the abbreviated form in **Diplomatic** (or click **From input** to copy from a block).
2. Type the full form in **Full** (or click **From output**).
3. Click **Add pair**.

### Or edit the examples file

Open `examples.json` in a text editor. Add pairs like this:

```json
[
  { "diplomatic": "grã", "full": "gratia" },
  { "diplomatic": "tempꝰ", "full": "tempus" }
]
```

More examples = better results. The app also saves learned pairs from expansions when **Learn** is on. Use **Layered Training** to include those learned pairs in the prompt.

---

## Command-line usage

For single files:
```bash
python -m expand_diplomatic --file document.xml
```

Output is saved as `document_expanded.xml` next to the original.

For many files:
```bash
python -m expand_diplomatic --batch-dir ./my_xml_folder --out-dir ./expanded
```

For parallel processing of multiple files (faster):
```bash
python -m expand_diplomatic --batch-dir ./my_xml_folder --parallel-files 4
```

Use the local backend (no API key):
```bash
python -m expand_diplomatic --backend local --file document.xml
```

---

## File types and format

- **Input:** XML files (TEI or PAGE XML).
- **Output:** Same structure and format, with only the text inside elements changed.
- **Blocks:** Paragraphs, lines, and similar elements (e.g. `p`, `l`, `Unicode` in PAGE) are expanded. Structure, namespaces, and attributes stay the same.
- **Pairing:** Input `file.xml` → Output `file_expanded.xml`. When you open a file, if `file_expanded.xml` exists in the same folder, it's loaded into the output panel.
- **Batch mode:** Files ending in `_expanded.xml` are skipped to avoid re-expanding.
- **Parallel files:** Use `Batch…` button (GUI) or `--parallel-files N` (CLI) to process multiple files simultaneously.
- **Format detection:** The status bar shows whether the loaded file is PAGE or TEI format.

---

## Advanced options

- **Container (Docker):** See the Container section below if you prefer to run in Docker.
- **Modality:** `full` (default), `conservative`, `normalize`, `aggressive` — control how much abbreviations/superscripts are expanded while staying faithful to the manuscript.
- **Environment variables:**  
  `GEMINI_MODEL`, `GEMINI_TIMEOUT`, `EXPANDER_MAX_CONCURRENT` and others can be set in `.env` or your system environment. See `.env.example` for details.

---

## Container (Docker)

If you use Docker, you can run the app in a container. Builds default to your detected hardware (Apple Silicon → arm64, Intel/AMD → amd64).

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
./run-container.sh --build -- --file sample.xml --out sample_expanded.xml
```

For local expansion only (no API key):
```bash
./run-container.sh --build -- --backend local --file sample.xml --out sample_expanded.xml
```

**Build options:**
- `./scripts/build-container-installs.sh` — Build for detected host (native arch)
- `./scripts/build-container-installs.sh --all` — Build linux/amd64 and linux/arm64
- `./scripts/build-docker.sh --load` — Same (native only); `--skip-ollama` for faster build

On Apple Silicon, uses arm64 (native) by default, not amd64 (emulated).

You need [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed and running.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | What to try |
|---------|-------------|
| “No module named …” | Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` (with your venv activated). |
| “API key” error | Add your key to `.env` or paste it when the app asks. |
| 429 / rate limit | Lower **Parallel** to 1 and wait before retrying. |
| Slow or stuck | Use **Local** backend or set `GEMINI_TIMEOUT=60` in `.env`. |
| “Ollama not reachable” | Either start Ollama (`ollama serve`) or ignore it — the app falls back to rule-based expansion. |
| Wrong expansions | Add more example pairs in Train or `examples.json`. |

---

## More options (CLI)

Useful flags when running from the command line:

- `--examples PATH` — Use a different examples file
- `--model ID` — Change Gemini model (default: gemini-3-flash-preview)
- `--block-by-block` — Expand each block separately instead of whole document in one call
- `--modality {full,conservative,normalize,aggressive,local}` — Manuscript expansion mode (`local` is tuned for non-Gemini models)
- `--passes N` — Run expansion multiple times (1–5)
- `--files-api` — Upload the full file to Gemini for extra context

See `.env.example` for environment variables (timeouts, retries, etc.).
